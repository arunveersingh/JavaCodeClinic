ðŸ”‹ Tell, Don't Ask ðŸ”‹

A principle which encourages to encapsulate behavior within objects rather than querying the state of an object and then making decisions based on that state.

In other words, you should TELL an object what to do, rather than ASKING it about its internal state and THEN deciding what to do based on that information.
